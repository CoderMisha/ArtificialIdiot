## Recommended Way to Run

Before running, please make sure you close all applications that will create pop-up windows. Any pop-up window will ruin the training.

Run `cs175_rllib.py`, **move your mouse cursor INTO the Minecraft window and CLICK ONCE**. This will allow PyAutoGUI to do all kinds of stuff like turn around and interact with the button that Malo can't do.

## Notice

In case you need to take the control of your mouse, you can *move the cursor into the one of the corner of the display*, and the PyAutoGUI will raise a `pyautogui.FailSafeException`.
